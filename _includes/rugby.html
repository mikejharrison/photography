<article class="rugby"><p class="lead">I went to see this rugby friendly between England and Wales with my dad, my uncle and my uncle's brother. A great way to spend a sunny Bank Holiday weekend watching some sport with family. </p><p>The game got off to a bit of disappointing start for England, with Wales pretty much on top and George Ford having misplaced his kicking boots (he made one kick all game!) but it got better later on. England scored 5 tries in the end to win the game 27 â€“ 13.</p><div class="rugby-gallery"><div class="full"><img src="/assets/img/rugby/tilt-shift.jpg" alt="England and Wales before kick off"/></div><div class="full"><img src="/assets/img/rugby/line-out.jpg" alt="Line out"/></div><div class="full"><img src="/assets/img/rugby/england-try.jpg" alt="England just about get it over for a try"/></div><div class="full"><img src="/assets/img/rugby/yarde-try.jpg" alt="Marlon Yarde on the way to scoring a try"/></div></div></article>
